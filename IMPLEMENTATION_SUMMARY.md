- ✅ Installed and configured `next-intl`
- ✅ Created locale-based routing (`/en`, `/ar`, `/es`, etc.)
- ✅ Set up middleware for automatic language detection
- ✅ Configured Next.js to support i18n plugin

### 2. **Translation System**
- ✅ Created 7 language files with complete translations:
  - **English (en)** - Fully translated
  - **Arabic (ar)** - Fully translated with RTL support
  - **Spanish (es)** - Fully translated
  - **French (fr)** - Placeholder (ready for translation)
  - **German (de)** - Placeholder (ready for translation)
  - **Russian (ru)** - Placeholder (ready for translation)
  - **Chinese (zh)** - Placeholder (ready for translation)

### 3. **Updated Components**
- ✅ Converted homepage to use translations
- ✅ Updated layout for locale-based routing
- ✅ Created language switcher component
- ✅ Implemented RTL support for Arabic

### 4. **Developer Documentation**
- ✅ **I18N_GUIDE.md** - Complete i18n documentation
- ✅ **QUICK_START.md** - Quick reference for developers
- ✅ **.cursorrules** - Enforced development rules
- ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - This file
- ✅ Updated README.md with i18n info

## 🎯 Key Features

### Type-Safe Translations
TypeScript ensures you can't access translation keys that don't exist:
```tsx
const t = useTranslations();
t('nonexistent.key') // TypeScript error!
```

### SEO-Friendly URLs
Each language gets its own URL path:
- English: `https://rakanclinic.com/en`
- Arabic: `https://rakanclinic.com/ar`
- Spanish: `https://rakanclinic.com/es`

### RTL Support
Arabic automatically uses right-to-left layout:
```tsx
<html lang="ar" dir="rtl">
```

### Language Switcher
Users can easily switch languages with the dropdown in the header.

```

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Developers:

**Adding new text:**
1. Add translation key to ALL files in `messages/`
2. Use in component: `const t = useTranslations(); ... {t('your.key')}`

**Example:**
```tsx
// messages/en.json
{ "cta": { "book": "Book Now" } }

// Component
const t = useTranslations();
<button>{t('cta.book')}</button>
```

### For Users:

**Switching languages:**
- Click the language dropdown in the header
- Select desired language
- Page automatically refreshes in new language

**Direct URL access:**
- `/en` - English
- `/ar` - Arabic
- `/es` - Spanish
- etc.

## 🎨 What Makes This System Special

### 1. **Impossible to Forget**
If you try to hardcode text, it simply won't be translated. The system encourages (forces) you to use translations.

### 2. **Type-Safe**
TypeScript integration means fewer runtime errors.

### 3. **Centralized**
All translations in one place (`messages/`) makes management easy.

### 4. **Scalable**
Adding new languages is as simple as copying a JSON file and translating it.

### 5. **SEO-Optimized**
Each language gets its own URLs, perfect for international SEO.
