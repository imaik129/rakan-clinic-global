    "description": "Find answers to the most common questions about our regenerative medicine treatments, international patient services, and clinic procedures.",
    "items": {
      "question1": "What types of regenerative medicine treatments do you offer?",
      "answer1": "We offer Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy and autologous adipose-derived stem cell therapy. These evidence-based treatments harness your body's natural healing capabilities to address joint pain, sports injuries, and chronic musculoskeletal conditions without surgery. All treatments are performed by JOA-certified orthopedic specialists and adhere to Japanese medical laws and ethical standards.",
      "question2": "How do I know if I'm a candidate for regenerative medicine?",
      "answer2": "Eligibility is determined on a case-by-case basis following a thorough medical evaluation by our physicians. We review your medical history, imaging studies, and current symptoms during a remote consultation. Common candidates include those with knee osteoarthritis, sports injuries, shoulder and hip pain, and spine conditions. We provide preliminary suitability screening before you travel to Tokyo.",
      "question3": "What is the cost of treatment and what does it include?",
      "answer3": "Our treatment packages range from $25,000~ for a single session to $200,000~ for an annual care program. Single sessions include consultation, treatment, and 1-month follow-up. Three-session packages include personalized treatment plans and 3-month follow-up. Annual programs include unlimited treatments and dedicated concierge service. All prices are estimates and final costs depend on individual treatment requirements.",
      "question4": "How long does the treatment process take?",
      "answer4": "The complete process typically takes 3-5 days in Tokyo. Day 1: Initial consultation and evaluation. Day 2: Treatment day (PRP or stem cell therapy). Days 3-5: Recovery and follow-up instructions. We provide detailed pre- and post-procedure instructions, and arrange telemedicine follow-ups once you return home. Travel planning support is included for international patients.",
      "question5": "Is regenerative medicine safe and what are the risks?",
      "answer5": "Yes, our treatments are very safe when performed by qualified specialists. All procedures are performed by JOA-certified orthopedic surgeons in our state-of-the-art facility. We use your own cells (autologous), eliminating rejection risks. Potential side effects are minimal and typically include mild discomfort, swelling, or bruising at the injection site. We provide comprehensive pre-treatment screening to ensure safety.",
      "question6": "Do you provide support for international patients?",
      "answer6": "Yes, we offer comprehensive international patient services including visa letters (if needed), hotel recommendations, airport transfers, and multilingual support. Our English-speaking coordinators ensure smooth communication throughout your stay. We provide travel planning assistance and can arrange accommodations in Tokyo's premium Azabudai Hills district, just 20 minutes from Haneda Airport.",
      "question7": "What makes Rakan Clinic different from other medical facilities?",
      "answer7": "We combine 35+ years of JOA-certified orthopedic expertise with cutting-edge regenerative medicine research. Our team includes University of Tokyo professors and leading researchers in osteoimmunology. We offer state-of-the-art in-house laboratory facilities, private consultation rooms for VIP patients, and a unique blend of Western orthopedics with Eastern medicine approaches. Our Azabudai Hills location provides premium, discreet care for elite clientele.",
      "question8": "How long does it take to see results from treatment?",
      "answer8": "Results vary by individual and condition, but many patients report initial improvements within 2-4 weeks. Full benefits typically develop over 3-6 months as the regenerative process continues. We provide detailed recovery timelines and regular follow-up care to monitor progress. Our telemedicine follow-up system ensures continued support after you return home, with progress tracking and adjustment recommendations as needed."

          "Stem cell therapy represents one of the most promising frontiers in modern regenerative medicine. At its core, stem cell therapy involves using the body's own master cells to repair, regenerate, and restore damaged tissues and organs.",
          "Stem cells are unique cells with two remarkable properties: they can divide and create more stem cells (self-renewal), and they can differentiate into specialized cell types such as muscle cells, nerve cells, or cartilage cells. This versatility makes them incredibly powerful tools for healing.",
          "At Rakan Clinic Tokyo, we specialize in autologous adipose-derived stem cell therapy. This means we harvest stem cells from your own fat tissue, process them in our state-of-the-art Cell Processing Center (CPC), and then reintroduce them to target areas where healing is needed.",
          "The process begins with a minimally invasive fat collection procedure. A small amount of adipose tissue (fat) is extracted, typically from the abdomen or thigh area. This tissue is rich in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are particularly effective for orthopedic and regenerative applications.",
          "These stem cells are then cultured and expanded in our in-house CPC under strict quality control protocols. The culture period typically lasts 6-8 weeks, during which the cells multiply while maintaining their regenerative potential.",
          "Once the stem cells are ready, they are administered via intravenous infusion or direct injection into the affected area. The stem cells then work to reduce inflammation, promote tissue regeneration, and stimulate the body's natural healing processes.",
          "Stem cell therapy has shown remarkable results in treating conditions such as osteoarthritis, sports injuries, chronic joint pain, and degenerative disc disease. Unlike traditional treatments that merely manage symptoms, stem cell therapy addresses the underlying cause by promoting actual tissue repair.",

Understanding the differences, benefits, and limitations of each option is crucial for making an informed decision.",
          "Traditional surgery, particularly joint replacement, has been the standard treatment for severe joint degeneration for decades. It's a well-established procedure with predictable outcomes, but it comes with significant drawbacks: invasive surgery, lengthy recovery periods, potential complications, and the fact that it's irreversible.",
          "Stem cell therapy, on the other hand, offers a minimally invasive alternative that uses your body's natural healing mechanisms. The procedure involves harvesting your own stem cells, processing them, and reintroducing them to promote regeneration. It's outpatient-based, has minimal downtime, and preserves your natural joint structure.",
          "One of the most significant advantages of stem cell therapy is the recovery time. While joint replacement surgery typically requires weeks of restricted activity, months of physical therapy, and up to a year for full recovery, stem cell therapy patients can often resume normal activities within days to weeks.",
          "However, it's important to understand that stem cell therapy is not always a replacement for surgery. In cases of severe joint damage, advanced arthritis, or when conservative treatments have failed, surgery may still be the most appropriate option. The decision should be made in consultation with experienced medical professionals who can assess your specific condition.",

Most patients experience only mild discomfort at the injection site, which usually resolves within 24-48 hours. You can typically return home the same day and resume light activities almost immediately.",

This is when the regenerative effects of the stem cells become more evident. However, it's important to continue following your doctor's recommendations regarding activity levels and any prescribed physical therapy.",
          "The full benefits of stem cell therapy may take 3-6 months to fully develop. This is because tissue regeneration is a gradual process. The stem cells need time to integrate, differentiate, and stimulate the body's natural healing mechanisms.",

This includes maintaining a healthy diet, staying hydrated, getting adequate rest, and following any prescribed physical therapy or exercise programs. Avoiding activities that could stress or damage the treated area is crucial during the early stages.",
